tailF: highlight given search

* take a file to watch as argument
* list last n lines
* enter search
* highlight last n lines(200?) when starting the program
    -should be done by more go routines
* after init search -> tail -f the file for the search
    * single routine that watches this
    -highlight search as well
* when new search was entered scan again last n lines -> and highlight for new search

helper:
* program that writes log lines to a sample file
    -when program gets started and lines are over 100_000 create a new one with 200 lines
* file with n lines to begin with

-compare n line scan vs tail -n | grep -> time, memory?

later:
-make it case insensitive
-able to and/or searches to grep for more than one word
    -&/| should act as checker to add for more
* able to add n lines override via argument -> that overrides default
-change search color via argument
